==================

Assume you have [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
installed.

This examples shows usage of declared in templates internal dependencies.

* `git clone https://github.com/hoho/conkitty.git conkitty`
* `cd conkitty/example2`
* `npm install`
* `gulp`
* open `dst/index.html` in your browser.

You can also run `gulp watch` to automatically recompile templates on change.

Templates sources are in `src/**/*.ctpl`. Check out `gulpfile.js`, it is pretty
simple.
